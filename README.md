# FAR (Freeze Asset Request) Standard

Documents in this repo describe and support a freeze-asset request (FAR) technical standard for digital asset freeze requests sent from individuals to exchanges.  Although the exact freeze-asset process might vary from different exchanges or for different types of incidents, there is a common demand for a clearly defined, community recognized standard for how to prepare a freeze-asset request.

The FAR_standard.pdf describes the content that should be included in every request so exchanges can quickly and easily validate and act upon the request.  We intend for this document to lead to a formal standard backed by major players in the web3 freeze-asseting process.
