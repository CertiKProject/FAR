## Overview

Documents in this repo describe and support a freeze-asset request (FAR) technical standard for digital asset freeze requests sent from individuals to exchanges.  Although the exact freeze-asset process might vary from different exchanges or for different types of incidents, there is a common demand for a clearly defined, community recognized standard for how to prepare a freeze-asset request.

The [FAR Standard](FAR_standard.pdf) describes the content that should be included in every request so exchanges can quickly and easily validate and act upon the request.  We intend for this document to lead to a formal standard backed by major players in the web3 freeze-asseting process.  

The [FAR Template](FAR_template.pdf) and the [FAR Example](FAR_example.pdf) includes a skeleton and example for applying FAR standard in practice.
